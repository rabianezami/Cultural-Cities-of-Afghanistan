      <h2>Explore the Diversity</h2>
      <p>
        Afghan cities are rich in history, tradition, and cultural
        diversity, each telling its own unique story. From the ancient 
        streets of Herat, known for its poetry and art, to Kabul’s 
        vibrant mix of old and new, every city reflects centuries of 
        resilience and heritage. Mazar-i-Sharif shines with its iconic
        Blue Mosque and springtime festivals, while Kandahar holds 
        deep historical and spiritual significance. These cities, 
        shaped by a blend of ethnic traditions, architecture, 
        and storytelling, offer a vivid glimpse into Afghanistan’s 
        soul and identity.
